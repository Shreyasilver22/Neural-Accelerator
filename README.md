🚀 Project Idea

We are building a low-power neural network accelerator designed for edge AI.
Benchmarks:

🫀 ECG classification → Normal vs. abnormal heartbeats.

🔢 MNIST digit recognition → Standard test baseline.

Goal: Prove that optimized, hardware-aware models can cut power consumption without killing accuracy.

⚡ What We’re Doing

Compact neural nets for ECG + MNIST

Quantization & pruning → lower power usage

Accelerator simulation with multi-MAC design

Benchmarks:
